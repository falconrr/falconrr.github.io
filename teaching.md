### Project-Based Learning

My teaching approach for content classes is based on project based learning. This teaching strategy consist on fostering learning based on the resolution of real-world problems encapsulated in a semester project, while providing students with a set of 21st century skills for their future careers and professions. For example, in a 4000-level class I taught entitled “Introduction to Spanish and Spanish American Dialectology”, the class explored the linguistic features of the Spanish language varieties of Latin America, Spain, Equatorial Guinea, and United States, while developing data-oriented and critical skills for the careers of my students. I introduced students to dialectometric analysis to visualize and measure dialectal differences through hands-on activities incorporated into a semester-long class project. By associating geographic coordinates in Google Earth with linguistic data containing dialectal features of Spanish varieties, students conducted a dialectometric analysis in [Gabmap](gabmap.nl), an online web application. The results of this class project were presented at a student symposium open to the public and the university community.  

I also applied this teaching strategy utilizing three course development grants over the past three years. Thanks to a grant awarded by the Center for European Studies at the University of Florida, I developed a class entitled “Language policies in Europe.” Grounded in Project-Based Learning, students engaged in a small-scale study on language policy research to address complex public problems in a territory where state and minority languages coexist. Students learned how to use Qualtrics for survey data collection and [RAWGraphs](https://rawgraphs.io/) for convenient data visualization and analytics. Results of the projects were presented in a new student symposium open to the academic community. I was awarded the Calvin A. VanderWerf award, given to graduate students for excellence in teaching at the University of Florida, because of my introduction of computational approaches to the linguistic classroom.
